# Fake-News-Classifier-LSTM


[Embedding Layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding): This layer will perform word embedding for all of the words in the training dataset.
[pad_sequences](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences): This layer helps in padding to make sure that all the sentences are of equal length before word embedding is performed.
[one_hot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/one_hot): It will help us transform sentences into one hot representation given a vocab size.
[Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential): Sequential groups a linear stack of layers into a tf.keras.Model
[LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM):
[Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense):
